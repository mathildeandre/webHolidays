Présenter le contexte dans lequel vous avez effectué votre stage : description de l’entreprise en lien avec le stage : organisation, enjeux pour l’entreprise, qui vous à encadré (une personne, une équipe, ...) (1 page maximum). Le «copier/coller» des sites web des entreprises est à proscrire !

\subsection{The company}

Pentila is a small company with 4 employees. They develop an application which is an electronic schoolbag. 
It is already used in some schools, especialy in Rhone Alpes. 
This application allows the educationnal community to . Parents can know their children's homeworks as well as their schedule. Students can hand in homework to their teachers directly on the website. It makes relation between school, parents and students easier. 

But as in all company, you always have to improve your work. My tasks were mostly to help installing some new software useful for the application or for the team work, but also to find bugs into their application and later fix them.
