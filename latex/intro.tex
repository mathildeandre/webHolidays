Introduire le sujet et l’articulation du rapport (2-3 paragraphes)

Within the studies at the Enginiering school ENSIMAG in Grenoble, every student has
to attend a two months internship within a company of his choice.
I worked with the 10 years old company named Pentila, located in Chambéry. 
This internship hold my attention because it was about web development which is a field 
that I wanted to know better. The application that I had to work on used modern
dynamic web technologie. \\  


This company develop a digital workspace inspired from the elcetronic schoolbag, it has
the same goals and functionalities. It aims to facilitate the flow of information between 
teachers, students and parents. \\

During this internship I had many tasks to do for the company that I could split into 3 main
areas that would be the development of my report.  
I will first discribe the company within the context of my work.
Then I will focus of the main tasks I had to do. First, I will explain the softwares 
installations I did for the company, why and how I did them. I will then move on the testing
area and the differents kind of testing I did. Finally I will explain how I fix the bugs 
found during the testing part. The last section would be about my feelings and outcome
learning of this internship.
