My tasks were related to differents fields such as installing new software for the team of deveopers, finding new bugs and reporting them into an application then fixing bugs. 
That's why I will present these tasks separately. 

\subsection{Instalation of Redmine}
Redmine is a software for project management and bug-tracking. I had to install this application in order to allow the team to track bugs in their app. \\ 
It was very useful for them to have an access into Redmine directly from their IDE (Eclipse). 
Hopefully, Redmine has several useful plugins available so I had to do some researchs to know which one could be useful for the developers, the goal was to make their work faster. Once this research done I had to install the plugins into Redmine. \\ 
The last step was to set up the Redmine's environment to allow the developers to use it easily.
