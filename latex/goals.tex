Présenter les objectifs du stage afin que vos évaluateurs cernent bien la limite entre l’existant et votre contribution réelle : (environ 5 pages)
\begin{itemize}
	\item le travail à réaliser ou le problème à résoudre
	\item l’état de l’art des solutions existantes et des contraintes fixées par l’entreprise
	\item votre solution motivée à partir de l’analyse ci dessus
\end{itemize}

My tasks were related to differents fields such as installing new software for the team of developers, finding new bugs and reporting them into an application then fixing bugs. 
In this part I will present these tasks separatly. For each of them, I will develop the demand the company, the limit they fix, and finally present my solution. 

\subsection{Redmine installation}
They are a team of 4 employees but they didn't have a tool for project management. 
They wanted a software that allow them to report bugs and keep a track of their work.
I had to install a software called Redmine.\\ 
Redmine is a software for project management and bug-tracking. I had to install this application in order to allow the team to track bugs in their app. \\ 
It was very useful for them to have an access into Redmine directly from their IDE (Eclipse).\\
It has several useful plugins available. My task were to find some plugins that fit the 
developers demands. 
Redmine is a open source software and is easy to install and use. 
First I installed Redmine into a web page.  
Then I did some research about all the plugins in order to choose the most usefull, the goal was to make developers works faster. 
At last, I set up Redmine's environment to allow developers to us it as easyly as possible.

\subsection{System testing}
The application was almost functionnal but it had some small bugs. The company needed to test it over and over.
For example, some services were totally functionnal on Firefox but didn't work so well on
Internet Explorer. I had to test all the services of the website, to report the bugs. \\
The company had one document with the an acceptance test plan for some
services of the application. 
First of all I did some acceptance testing in order to continue and finish 
to write de document. 
Then I did some regression testing.


I looked at the existing software for functionnal tests. One could be very useful for the company, it's called JMeter. The other stagiare installed it and register some scenarios into it.

\subsection{Bugs fixing}
Once the bugs tracking done, I had to fix some bugs. 
The company gave me a document that explain how to install the source code on your OS. 

I had to follow it in order to have access to all their codes and their classes. To do that, I decided to first understand how the application work exactly. 
So I made some researches about Tomcat, Liferay, Solr and ldap and then install everything. 

I had to correct some bugs very diffenrents at each other. Some about Tomcat, some about ldap
but most of them was Javascript, Html or Css. 
That's why I followed some tutorials about all of these web programming languages. 
I looked at the navigator debuggers for js, html and css.
