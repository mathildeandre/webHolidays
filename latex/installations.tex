\section{Softwares installation}
In this part I will discuss the different softwares I have installed for the company.
As I said in the previous part, the company needed a tool for project managing and asked
me to install Redmine's software. 
Firstofall I will focus on the researches I have done and the plugins I finally
installed. 
Then the details of the installation will be presented. To finish I will explain how I set
up the environment and how team members can now work with this new software.

I dind't know a lot about project managing so I had to look what was Redmine for and what
 this application will allow the developers to do.  
Redmine is a powerful web based project managing which allow bugs tracking. It allows the
users to create a collection of issues and then see a Gant chart given by the start and 
end dates of issues. You can also look at a calendar to see what happened on a particular
day. The best thing about Redmine is that it is very easy to use. When working on a issue
for example you can update it in one click or add notes to it very quickly. 
 It is possible to add a lot of functionalities to this application by intalling some 
 plugings into it. 

This open-source software is written in Ruby and to install it we need to have the right versions of
Ruby and Rails, depending of the redmine version we want.  

 The developers team needed to keep a track of building versions of their application.
 They also needed to have access to Redmine from Eclipse in order to see and change 
 some issues from their IDE for example. 
I read about all the plugings for Redmine and I finally chose some of them. 
Here is a quick presentation of these plugins :
