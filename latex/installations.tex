	\item architecture de votre solution (vision haut niveau)
	\item implémentation de votre solution (détail technique) ou de la partie la plus intéressante si la place manque

\end{itemize}

In this part I will discuss the diffenrents softwares I have installed for the company. Firstofall I will focus on the research I have done. Then the details of the installation will be detailed.

I dind't know a lot about project managing so I had to look what was Redmine for and what this application will allow us to do. \\ 
Redmine is a powerful web based project managing which allow bugs tracking. It is possible to add a lot of functionalities to this application in intalling  some plugings into it. \\ 
\newpage
I read about all the plugings for Redmine and finally chose some of them  
	\begin{figure}[h]

		Jenkins. \\
		This application provides an easy to use continuous integration system. 
		It is an application that monitors executions of repeated jobs such as bulding, testing a software project.
		It has 3 main features : 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It allows a team to share common information easily.
			\item It executes automatically compilation, testing without human intervention.
			\item It keeps a track of previous productions and allow us to see their development. 
		\end{itemize}

		Mylin for eclipse connection. \\
		Mylin is the task and application lifecycle management framework for Eclipse
		It allows to visualize tasks from Redmine repositorie and it has a connector to Jenkins. \\ 
		It helps a developer to work efficiently with many different tasks (such as bugs, problem reports or new features). In a nutshell, it improves their productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. \\

		\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{Images/ldap.jpeg} 
		Ldap authentification. \\
		Ldap is a protocol that allow us to access and maintain directory services. So we can access to some informations about the users of a network over TCP/IP protocol. 
		With the ldap authentification into redmine, the users don't need to create a Redmine's account but they can directly access into their redmine's project by using their ldap password and login.
